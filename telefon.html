<p>Founding of the company In the 1930s, entrepreneur Lee Byung-chul opened his own rice flour business in Korea. A small warehouse in the city of Daegu is the beginning of a great story for Samsung. At that time, Korea was a colony of Japan , and it was quite difficult to engage in private business in the country . However, already in 1938, Li managed to create the first independent export channel from Korea to China and Manchuria . The active development of the supply of food products, such as rice , sugar and dried fish, made it possible to officially register a trademarkSamsung Trading Company. The foreign (for Korea) origin of the name was the result of the far-reaching ambitious plans of the Korean entrepreneur: by the end of the 1950s, Byong-chul was going to establish trade with the countries of the American continent . And after the US troops landed on the Korean Peninsula , the products of the plant for the production of rice vodka and beer began to be sold to representatives of the allied forces. The Korean War put an end to this business. Warehouses were looted and burned in the same way as the main factories of the company.Warehouse in Daegu, 1938
There is a legend that on the ruins of a burned house, Byung-chul found a hidden box with money, which he invested in his new business. It was a textile factory, a sugar factory, and later an insurance business. Byung-chul grew rich quickly despite the fact that the average per capita income in Korea in the 1960s did not exceed $80. [3] At that time, even in the capital, Seoul, there was no permanent electricity, electricity was supplied for several hours a day, and there was no centralized water supply. Rapid military coup overthrows Syngman Rhee, president and close friend of Byung-chul, who, as a wealthy entrepreneur, was part of the inner circle of the disgraced ruler. Lee Byung-chul himself was imprisoned for bribery and close acquaintance with the deposed president.Samsung after the Korean War The new president of South Korea, General Park Chung-hee , began industrial and economic reforms. A program for the development of the industrial sector of the economy was developed, an increased focus on exports was supported by close relations with the United States, it was supposed to take foreign loans, purchase raw materials and modern technologies, and re-use the resulting profit for the purchase of raw materials and equipment. The Korean reformers concluded that a stable economy should be based on large concerns, but they needed to be created in the shortest possible time, so government loans and loans were provided to the most prominent businessmen in Korea. They were secured by government orders, while certain legal and tax breaks made it possible for small businesses to grow into vast conglomerates. Among the successful entrepreneurs was Lee Byung-chul [3] .Thus, 30 large companies were created ( chaebols  - "money families"). Among them, in addition to Samsung, were Daewoo , Hyundai , Goldstar (LG) , etc. Each "money family" had its own direction: Daewoo - car production, Goldstar - household appliances, Samsung - electronics, Hyundai - construction, etc. Further.Reformation of the company The economy of South Korea developed at a rapid pace from 6 to 14% per year. The increase in exports during this period amounted to 30%. So in1969 , when Samsung, after merging with Sanyo , began producing black-and-white TVs, only 2% of the population in Korea had them [3] .The merger of Sanyo and Samsung marked the beginning of one of the largest sectors of the Samsung Group - Samsung Electronics . The company managed, albeit at heavy losses, to survive the economic crisis of the 1980s . The price of the crisis is several non-core divisions, a sharp reduction in the number of subsidiaries. With the coming to the board of Lee Gong-hee, the youngest son of Lee Byung-chul, a whole range of reforms was proposed, which included not only a complete restructuring of the company, but also a change in the very foundations of management: the company had to fully comply with the conditions of the free trade law. The proposals to change the policy towards external investors were supposed to increase the company's attractiveness for subsidies, as the conglomerate lost financial support from the state.Until the 1980s, the shares of the companies belonging to the concern were circulated only in South Korea, while they were in rather low demand from investors. The reason is traditionally Asian management according to the principles of Confucianism: at the head of the board were exclusively representatives of the Li family. The levers of influence on decision-making in the field of company management were completely absent from external investors. In addition, traditional management meant lifelong employment and career advancement based on years of service.Marketing changes were introduced, a complete reworking of the company's mission and a change in its symbol. The first two company logos featured three red stars. But the management of Samsung, considering the former logo inappropriate for the image of an international corporation , decided to replace it. It was then that the modern emblem saw the light  - a dynamically inclined blue ellipse with the name of the company written inside . The design and large-scale advertising campaign did their job: the logo became one of the most recognizable in the world [4] . Advertising students at leading universities are now studying the Samsung logo change as an example of an exceptionally successfulrebranding [5] .When developing a new emblem, it was not without oriental philosophy. According to the company's representatives, "the elliptical shape of the logo.
